# ü§î What is J100758.269-211525.201?
This is a GDI trojan (originally safety) made by VenraTech, and made destructive by me.
It's made in C++.

# ‚ù§Ô∏è For Skidders
I know some of you may skid the source code without giving credit, so...

In order for your project to not be derailed, you must release the source code of your project and <b>credit me.</b>
This is because I added a GPL v3.0 licence, so anybody except VenraTech must follow the above policies.
